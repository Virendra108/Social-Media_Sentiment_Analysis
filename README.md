## **Usage**  
1. Prepare your dataset:  
   - Place your dataset in the project directory and rename it to `twitter_data.csv`.

2. Run the preprocessing script:  
   - Clean and preprocess the text data for model training.  

3. Split the data:  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  

4. Train the model:  
   - Build and train a machine learning model using `Logistic Regression` or any other classifier.  

5. Evaluate the model:  
   - Test the model on unseen data and calculate accuracy metrics.
